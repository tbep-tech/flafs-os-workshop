## Goals and motivation

This is the third module in our workshop on open science. Now we focus on how Quarto can be used as a document preparation system to generate easily shared web content.

-   **Goal**: understand best practices for reproducible documents using Quarto
-   **Motivation**: cultivate your analyses as living, shared resources

## Quarto

Quarto is a relatively new document preparation system that lets you create reproducible and dynamic content that is easily shared with others.  Quarto is integrated with RStudio and allows you to combine plain text language with analysis code in the same document.  

This next section will run through the very basics of creating a Quarto document, some of the options for formatting, and how to generate shared content.  You'll follow along in this module. 

1. Create a new project in RStudio, first open RStudio and then select "New project" from the File menu at the top.

    Then select "New Directory".  Create a directory in a location that's easy to find. 

1. Open a new Quarto file from the File menu under "Quarto Document".

Let's get familiar with the components of a Quarto document. 

The top is YAML, this defines things like the title, date, format, and other options

The parts in ticks are R code. 

Everything else is Markdown.  This where we add text describing anything we want, using markdown syntax to minimally alter appearance of the text. 

The source file is a .qmd document.  We need to render the document to create the output format.  The following happens when you hit the render button.
