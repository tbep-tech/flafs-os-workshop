Welcome to the 2023 Florida AFS open science workshop. Open science (OS) has been advocated as an effective approach to create reproducible, transparent, and actionable research products. However, widespread adoption among the research and management community has not occurred despite its perceived benefits. In the face of major challenges like global warming and sea level rise, the collaborative framework provided by OS is needed now more than ever. This workshop will cover material introducing participants to core concepts of OS. The target audience includes anyone interested in applying OS in their own workflows as part of a larger research and resource management team.

By the end of this workshop, you should have a good understanding of fundamental concepts in open science and how they can be applied to help bridge the research-management divide. You will also have the skills to understand how collaborative open science tools can be used to increase efficiency and transparency, understand fundamental best practices for working with data to facilitate openness, and be able to apply these lessons within your own teams by effectively addressing barriers to adoption.

## Prepare

Please attend the workshop with a personal laptop and power supply. Make sure your laptop can access publicly available WiFi. __You will also need to install software prior to the workshop, visit the setup page for more info__.  We will have limited capacity to help with installation issues the day of the workshop, so please come prepared.  The setup instructions will guide you through the following.

1. GitHub create account: [link](https://github.com){target="_blank"}
1. Install Git: [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){target="_blank"}
1. Install R: [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/){target="_blank"}
1. Install RStudio: [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"}
1. Install Quarto: [link](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/){target="_blank"}

We also assume some knowledge about R.  Please visit this page for a crash course if you need to brush up on your R skills. 

## Agenda

1.  [The basics of open science](#basics): 12:30 - 1:00
2.  [Open science for collaboration](#collaborate): 1:00 - 2:00
