# Setup for the Workshop {.unnumbered}

Thanks for your interest in the open science workshop. We recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the interface to R. In order to use the package, you will need to make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.

Thanks to the [USGS-R Training group](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training.html) and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) for making their installation materials available. The following instructions come directly from their materials, with a few minor edits to help you get set up.

## Install R and RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing software. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. *You need to install R before you install RStudio*.

### *Windows*: Download and install R

Go to [CRAN and download](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/) the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version (v4.2.3 as of April 2023).

Once the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".

Type in your credentials and click yes (or if you don't have administrator access have your IT rep install with Admin privileges).

You can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\\Program Files\\R

At the "Select Components" screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

At this screen, uncheck 'Create a desktop icon' because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.

### *Windows*: Download and install RStudio

Download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

After download, double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install (you might need to have your IT rep install again).

Accept all the default options for the RStudio install.

### *macOS*: Download and install R

-   Download and install R from the CRAN website for Mac [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).

-   It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed by some packages)

### *macOS*: Download and install RStudio

-   Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) download page
-   Under Installers select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
-   Double click the file to install RStudio

## Posit Cloud (optional)

If you can't install R or RStudio prior to the workshop, you can use use RStudio in the cloud on the Posit website. This is only a backup option and we strongly encourage you to troubleshoot the installation when able.

To use RStudio in the cloud, copy this link and paste it in a web browser: <https://posit.cloud/project/4426781>

If you do not have a Posit Cloud account, you will see this screen when you first visit the URL:
