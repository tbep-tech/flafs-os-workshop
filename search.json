    "text": "Course synopsis\nWelcome to the 2023 Florida AFS open science workshop. Open science (OS) has been advocated as an effective approach to create reproducible, transparent, and actionable research products. However, widespread adoption among the research and management community has not occurred despite its perceived benefits. In the face of major challenges like global warming and sea level rise, the collaborative framework provided by OS is needed now more than ever. This workshop will cover material introducing participants to core concepts of OS. The target audience includes anyone interested in applying OS in their own workflows as part of a larger research and resource management team.\nBy the end of this workshop, you should have a good understanding of fundamental concepts in open science and how they can be applied to help bridge the research-management divide. You will also have the skills to understand how collaborative open science tools can be used to increase efficiency and transparency, understand fundamental best practices for working with data to facilitate openness, and create reproducible Quarto documents.\nMuch of the content on this web page was adopted from the TBEP Data Management SOP."

    "section": "1.2 Why open science?",
    "text": "1.2 Why open science?\nLet’s start with revisiting the scientific process. I’m sure this looks familiar to all of you. This is geared towards an applied research question.\n\nOur basic scientific approach to discovery is motivated by a question or research goal, developing a hypothesis for the question, collecting data based on the hypothesis, developing a tool that can be used for decision-making, and summarizing the results in a conventional format.\nMany scientists, especially early career researchers (my past self included), may assume that this is sufficient to affect change. We write the report, send it out into the world, and move on to the next project. This is a common mentality:\n\n“This 500-page report will answer all of their questions!”\n\nFrom the other side, such as the manager or policy-maker, the report may be received like this:\n\n“This 500-page report answers none of my questions!”\n\nIt’s dense, inaccessible, and there are probably questions about the underlying data and methods used to achieve the results. More importantly, it doesn’t present the information in an easily digestible format to quickly make the right decision. Sometimes, if you think you’re doing applied science, it may just be implied science that falls short of application.\nWhy is this conventional approach to science ineffective at seeding change?\nThe environmental management community is often siloed with each branch doing their own thing and speaking their own language. Between the research (typically academic) and management community, we call this the research-management divide.\n\nA distinct gap exists between how scientific products are developed and how they can be used to meet management needs. This is often the result of communication barriers, irreproducible results, information loss with poor documentation, inaccessible data, and opaque workflows known only to the analyst.\nThese barriers can occur at any stage of the research process. This compelling graphic from Michener et al. (1997) describes the atrophy of information in a closed approach to creating science.\n\nThe last part is especially morbid. Sometimes, this is called the “bus factor”. What would happen to your important work and life achievements if you were hit by a bus? Would others be able to pick it up? Research products with a high bus factor are at risk of being lost if critical team members are no longer available. This is a very real problem for continuity of science.\n\nSo how do we make changes to our workflows to ensure we can achieve truly applied science using open tools and philosophies?"

    "section": "1.3 Learning and speaking the language of open science",
    "text": "1.3 Learning and speaking the language of open science\nThe tools and broader philosophy behind open science can help us bridge the research-management divide. It involves a fundamental shift in how we approach the scientific process, both for your own internal workflows and how you can engage others in the process. By others, we mean not just researchers, but specifically those that need the information to make informed decisions. This also includes your future self.\nNow let’s settle on a definition for open science (from Open Knowledge International, http://opendefinition.org/, https://creativecommons.org/):\n\n“The practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.”\n\nKey words from this definition are italicized. There are very specific tools in the open science toolbox that enable each of these key words. We’ll cover some of these later.\nSimilarly, the current administration has declared 2023 the Year of Open Science. Their definition is:\n\n“The principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity.”\n\nWe can can breakdown these definitions into key principles.\n\n Open data\n\nPublic availability of data\nReusability and transparent workflows\nData provenance and metadata\n\n Open process\n\nIterative methods using reproducible workflows\nCollaboration with colleagues using web-based tools\nLeveraging external, open-source applications\n\n Open products\n\nInteractive web products for communication\nDynamic documents with source code\nIntegration with external networks for discoverability\n\n\nYou’ll notice that web-based tools and open science are often discussed at the same time. Science existed before the internet. Open science often focuses on how the two can leverage and support one another despite the latter being a relatively new addition to society. We often describe web-based tools as synonymous with open science.\nAdvocates of open science also use the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) as guidelines. The FAIR acronym stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Anybody should be able to find your science, access it once it’s found, use it in different environments, and reproduce it for additional analysis."

This can help you better navigate conversations and become an advocate for open science in your own right.\nA useful paradigm is provided by Fecher and Friesike (2014) to describe open science as five distinct schools of thought:\n\nThese are of course only conceptual boxes and there’s considerable overlap across all schools when open science is used in practice. For our purposes, we’ll mostly be talking about ideas and tools from the pragmatic, infrastructure, and democratic schools of thought. The end goal is to provide you with the means to create more efficient and impactful science that can more readily be used by others in a collaborative setting.\n\n\n\n\nFecher, B., and S.

    "section": "2.2 Essential elements of collaboration",
    "text": "2.2 Essential elements of collaboration\nWe start our deep dive into open science by focusing on collaboration as a fundamental activity that can be enhanced through transparent, efficient, and reproducible tools. Having effective tools to work together is a critical theme of many open science practices. There are many tools in the toolbox and we need to introduce some core concepts before we demonstrate how to implement them in practice.\n\n2.2.1 Workflow management\nHow do you organize your work each day? How do you make sure projects are on schedule and pressing deadlines are met? How do you plan for short-term and long-term goals? Do you have a five-year, ten-year, or longer career plan?\nWork to achieve goals cannot be accomplished without a systematic approach to organizing tasks. Chances are, we each have our own system that works for us and was probably developed through trial and error. Although everyone has familiar workflows, they are often idiosyncratic and deeply entrenched by habit. That can be in direct conflict with collaboration when we try to mesh internal workflows with those of others.\nDoes this look familiar?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the above comic from xkcd speaks directly to file management, it hints at a broader problem of personal information management that can seriously complicate working with others. I’m sure we’ve all struggled to find that one file for that one project from a vague recollection of seeing it a few months ago.\nCollaborative work can be facilitated through workflow management that helps you break out of old habits. We’ll introduce some specific internet-based tools below to facilitate workflows either for yourself or, better yet, working with others. These can help propel you towards open science.\n\n\n2.2.2 Version control\nA specific problem for workflow management that can be solved by open science tools is file management. Workflows can be immensely enhanced by tools that use strict guidelines for tracking changes and allowing a complete view of the evolution of a project. This is where version control comes in.\nI’m sure many of you have fallen into this trap:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion control is a way to track the development history of a project. It serves the joint purposes of:\n\nFormally documenting the changes that have been made to code or software\nMaking sure that the development history is permanent\nProviding a system for collaborating across platforms (with friends!)\n\nIt’s more than saving files. Documenting changes with a set of commands that follow strict rules provides a transparent record for yourself and others, and establishing permanency ensures that any of the changes that are made can be vetted and accessed as needed. Think of it as an insurance plan for your project.\nIf you’ve ever used Google Docs, you might have noticed a feature that looks a lot like version control. The Google Drive platform is a great way to start working together and a great way to familiarize yourself with the basics of version control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any Google Doc, clicking on the link shown by the arrow will open the Version history pane which shows all of the edits that were made to the document. You can view any of the edits, who made the edits, view the changes (before/after) in the document, or even restore the document to a previous version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the building blocks of version control as demonstrated with Google Docs:\n\nNo iterative and ambiguous file naming\nHistory of changes assigned to each editor\nAbility to restore a previous version\n\nPerhaps more importantly, these tools are in the cloud and openly accessible (unlike other cloud-based services). File links (via a URL) also do not change if a file is moved to a different location in the drive. Overall, the Google platform is an accessible means of improving collaboration (but not without it’s cons).\n\n\n2.2.3 Git and GitHub\nAlthough Google products can get you a long way towards better collaboration, they do not use dedicated version control software. These tools become more important as your projects become more complex - those beyond simple documents or spreadsheets.\nThe most widely used software for version control is Git. Although we do not cover the specifics of this software, it’s useful to understand the purpose and what it can do in making your work more open and impactful. Git is integrated with many popular open source development platforms, such as RStudio.\nMany people often confuse Git with GitHub. GitHub is an online platform for working collaboratively through Git AND it allows you to be open with your work. We’ll provide some examples below of how this can be done. Importantly, you do not need to be an expert in Git to be able to use GitHub. This speaks volumes for how team efficiency can be improved with GitHub through better collaboration.\nThis recent blog provides a helpful introduction to Git/GitHub for the casual user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctocat, the strange and loveable mascot of GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn\n\nWorkflow management in the real world - using GitHub to collaborate. Here we present some examples from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program State of the Bay report and water quality report card.\n\n Watch and learn\n\nNow we’ll demonstrate how to setup a version control project with RStudio, Git, and GitHub. This example will cover:\n\nCreating the project in GitHub\nCreating a file, adding content, and committing it to the project\nSetting up issues in GitHub\nAdding members to the project\nCreating a Kanban project board to assign tasks\n\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nIn small groups, setup a shared workspace using GitHub and create a project management board. Some real world examples of why you might do this were presented in the earlier watch and learn.\n\nOpen GitHub in a web browser and have one person create a new repository (the big, green “New” button in Repositories). Add each member to the repository after it’s created (hint: Settings -> Collaborators)\nHave that same person create a project board for the repository (Hint: Projects -> New project -> board format)\nAfter each person accepts the invitation to the repository (check your email!), each new member create a new file in the repository (Hint: Click “Add file” near the top). Name it something unique, save and commit the changes\nAssign issues to different members of the repository to do something to the new files (Hint: on the right menu, select “Assignees”). Add the issue to the project board (Hint: on the right menu, select “Projects” and click the new project).\nWork on the issues until the time is up. Close each issue as they’re completed."

    "section": "3.2 Quarto",
    "text": "3.2 Quarto\nQuarto is a relatively new document preparation system that lets you create reproducible and dynamic content that is easily shared with others. Quarto is integrated with RStudio and allows you to combine plain text language with analysis code in the same document.\nQuarto belongs to a class of reporting tools called dynamic documents or literate programming. It is not the first of its kind, but it builds substantially on its predecessors by bridging multiple programming langues.\nAdvantages of creating analyses using Quarto include:\n\nClear demonstration of a workflow using plain text and code\nReproducible materials allows others to use your work\nEasily shared content (e.g., on GitHub)\n\nThis next section will run through the very basics of creating a Quarto document, some of the options for formatting, and how to generate shared content. You’ll follow along in this module.\n\nCreate a new project in RStudio, first open RStudio and then select “New project” from the File menu at the top.\n\nThen select “New Directory”. Create a directory in a location that’s easy to find.\n\nOpen a new Quarto file from the File menu under New file > Quarto Document.\n\nEnter a title for the document (e.g., “Quarto practice”) and your name as the author. Use the defaults for the other options and hit “Create”.\n\nSave the file in the project root directory (give it any name you want).\nLet’s get familiar with the components of a Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe three types of information included in a Quarto document are:\n\nYAML\nCode chunks\nPlain or Markdown text\n\n\n\nThe new file is completely empty except for the title, name, and editor type at the top. The content at the top is called YAML, which defines global options for the document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\n---\nYou’ll also notice that there’s a button on the top-left that lets you toggle between “source” or “visual” editor mode. The source editor simply lets you add text to the document, whereas the visual editor lets you add content that is partially rendered. First time Quarto users may prefer the visual editor.\n\nUsing the visual editor, we can insert a code chunk (or code cell). This can be done by selecting the appropriate option from the Insert menu. Note the variety of programming langues that can be used with the code chunk.\n\nWe can enter any code we want in the code chunks, including options for how the code chunk is evaluated. Options are specified using the hashpipe notation, #|.\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\nprint('Hello Quarto!')\n```\nWhen the file is rendered, the code is run and results displayed in the output. There are many options to change how code chunks are executed, which we’ll discuss below.\n\nprint('Hello Quarto!')\n\n[1] \"Hello Quarto!\"\n\n\nWe can also run the code chunks separately without rendering the file using the arrow buttons on the top right in the source document. This can be useful for quickly evaluating your code as you include it in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCode chunks are executed in the order they appear in the document when a .qmd file is rendered.\n\n\nDescriptive text can be entered anywhere else in the file. This is where we can describe in plain language what our analysis does or any other relevant information. Text can be entered as-is or using simple markdown text that can format the appearance of the output. If you’re using the visual editor, you can use some of the items in the file menu to modify the text appearance. In the source editor, you can manually enter markdown text:\n\n\nI  can write anything I want right here. Here's some **bold text**.\n\nI can also make lists\n\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n\n\n\nWhen the file is rendered, the markdown text will be formatted. The text will be formatted already using the visual editor:\nI can write anything I want right here. Here’s some bold text.\nI can also make lists\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\nRender the .qmd file to the output format.\nThe source file is a .qmd document. We need to render the document to create the output format - HTML (default), PDF, or Word. The following happens when you hit the render button at the top.\n\nHere’s what your RStudio session should look like (note the three parts of the source .qmd document - YAML, code chunk, and Markdown text). The rendered HTML file will appear in the Viewer pane on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA rendered Quarto document as an HTML, PDF, Word, or other file format is stand-alone and can be shared with anybody!\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Code chunk options\nThe behavior of the code chunks when the file is rendered can be changed using the many options available in Quarto. This can be useful for a few reasons.\n\nOnly displaying the output of a code chunk\nOnly displaying the code and not running the chunk\nRunning the code without displaying output for use\nSuppressing warnings and messages\nDefining table or figure options (e.g., height, width, captions, etc.)\n\nCode chunk options can be applied globally to all chunks in the document or separately for each chunk.\nTo apply them globally, they’ll look something like this in the YAML, where options are added after execute:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\n\nexecute: \n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBe careful with indentation in the YAML, the document won’t render if the indentation is incorrect.\n\n\nTo apply to individual code chunks, use the #| (hashpipe) notation at the top of the code chunk. This will override any global options if you’ve included them in the YAML. Below, echo: true indicates that the code will be displayed in the output.\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\nplot(1:10)\n```\nHere’s a short list of other useful execution options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neval\nEvaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output).\n\n\necho\nInclude the source code in output\n\n\noutput\nInclude the results of executing the code in the output (true, false, or asis to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto’s standard enclosing markdown).\n\n\nwarning\nInclude warnings in the output.\n\n\nerror\nInclude errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).\n\n\ninclude\nCatch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. include: false suppresses all output from the code block).\n\n\nmessage\nInclude messages in rendered output\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Figures and tables\nFigures and tables are easily added in Quarto, using either R code or importing from an external source.\nAny figures created in code chunks will be included in the rendered output. Relevant code chunk options for figures include fig-height, fig-width, fig-cap, label (for cross-referencing) and fig-align.\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-myhist\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-width: 6\n#| fig-cap: \"Here's my awesome histogram.\"\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\nvals <- rnorm(100)\nhist(vals)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Here’s my awesome histogram.\n\n\n\n\nFigures can be cross-referenced in the text using the @ notation with the figure label.\nHere's a cross-reference to @fig-myhist.\nWhen the file is rendered, the appropriate figure number will be displayed with a link to the figure:\nHere’s a cross-reference to Figure 3.1.\nSimilarly, tabular output can be created inside code chunks.\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-mytable\n#| tbl-cap: \"Here's my awesome table.\"\ntotab <- data.frame(\n  Species = c('Bluegill', 'Largemouth bass', 'Crappie'),\n  Count = c(12, 5, 4)\n)\nknitr::kable(totab)\n```\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Here’s my awesome table.\n\n\nSpecies\nCount\n\n\n\n\nBluegill\n12\n\n\nLargemouth bass\n5\n\n\nCrappie\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a cross-reference:\nHere's a cross-reference to @tbl-mytable.\nHere’s a cross-reference to Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLabel tags for tables and figures should include the tbl- or fig- prefix for proper cross-referencing.\n\n\nFigures can also be imported from an external source (e.g., from your computer or the web) using this notation, where the image is in the img folder in my working directory.\n![](img/blackcrappie.jpg)\n You can also add a figure from a URL using the same notation.\n![](https://www.bigcatchflorida.com/media/1174/blackcrappie.jpg)\n Adding captions and labels to external figures looks something like this:\n![Here's a beautiful crappie](img/blackcrappie.jpg){#fig-crappie}\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Here’s a beautiful crappie\n\n\nThe cross-reference is done the same.\nHere's a cross-reference to @fig-crappie\nHere’s a cross-reference to Figure 3.2.\nLikewise, tables can be imported from an external source (e.g., Excel). You’ll want to do this in a code chunk and add the appropriate options (e.g., to cross-reference Table 3.2).\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-habitats\n#| tbl-cap: \"The first six rows of our tidy data\"\nmytab <- readxl::read_excel('data/tidy.xlsx')[1:6, ]\nknitr::kable(mytab)\n```\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: The first six rows of our tidy data\n\n\nLocation\nHabitat\nYear\nAcres\nCategory\n\n\n\n\nClear Bay\nSeagrass\n2019\n519\nB\n\n\nClear Bay\nOysters\n2019\n390\nB\n\n\nClear Bay\nSand\n2019\n742\nC\n\n\nFish Bay\nSeagrass\n2019\n930\nB\n\n\nFish Bay\nOysters\n2019\n680\nA\n\n\nFish Bay\nSand\n2019\n611\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit these links for full details on figures and tables in Quarto. R also has a rich library of packages for producing tables, most of which play nice with Quarto.\n\n\n3.2.3 Output options\nRendering a Quarto file to an HTML, PDF, or Word document is as simple as adding the appropriate option to the YAML. You can select the format when you create a new Quarto file just by selecting the appropriate option:\n\nThe output format can also be added in the YAML of the document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\nformat: html\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe default output format is HTML and it does not need to be added explicitly to the YAML.\n\n\nAlternative formats are specified the same way.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\nformat: docx\n---\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\nformat: pdf\n---\nYou can also specify multiple formats (note the indentation). The default setting just indicates that we want to use all default options for each format.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\nformat: \n  html: default\n  docx: default\n  pdf: default\n---\nYou can use the dropdown menu to render each file format one at a time.\n\nYou can also render all formats at once using the quarto package or from the terminal tab. The path to your file will differ depending on where it is in your working directory.\nquarto::quarto_render('data/quartoex.qmd')\nIn the terminal (bottom left pane of RStudio), execute the following to render all formats. This requires the separate installation of Quarto described in the setup.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render data/quartoex.qmd\n\nRendering a file to PDF uses LaTeX and you’ll need to install tinytex before you can use this option.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto install tool tinytex\n\nThere are also several options you can include in the YAML to control the formatting of the output. Some of the options can apply to all format types, whereas others are specific to each. Here’s an example building out these options further.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto practice\"\nauthor: \"Marcus Beck\"\neditor: visual\ntoc: true \nnumber-sections: true\nformat: \n  html: \n    code-fold: true\n  docx: default\n  pdf: \n    geometry: \n      - top=30mm\n      - left=0mm\n---\nIn the above example, there are two new options that apply globally to the HTML, Word, and PDF outputs. Specifically, we’ve indicated that we’d like a table of contents (toc: true) and that the sections should be numbered (number-sections: true).\nWe’ave also added some specific options to the HTML and PDF output. For the HTML output, we’ve indicated that we want the code chunks to be folded (i.e., toggle between seen and not seen). For the PDFoutput, we’ve slightly changed the geometry of the margins.\nHere’s what the HTML output would look like:\n\nThere are many other options aviable, as well as other format types. View the full list here: https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html\n\n\n3.2.4 Authoring\nIt’s entirely possible to create reports and manuscripts with Quarto, not to mention much easier since your analysis, data, and writing can all be done in the same place.\ncross-references, citations\n\n\n3.2.5 Publishing"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tabular data allow you to store information, where observations are in rows and variables are in columns. It’s very common to try to make tabular data more than it should be. Unless you spend a lot of time working with data, it can be difficult to recognize common mistakes that lead to table abuse.\nBefore we get into tidy data, we need to discuss some of the downfalls of Excel as a data management system. There are many examples that demonstrate how Excel has contributed to costly mistakes through table abuse or outright negligence, often to the detriment of science (Ziemann, Eren, and El-Osta 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcel allows you to abuse your data in many ways, such as adding color to cells, embedding formulas, and automatically formatting cell types. This creates problems when the organization is ambiguous and only has meaning inside the head of the person who created the spreadsheet. Embedding formulas that reference specific locations in or across spreadsheets is also a nightmare scenario for reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you absolutely must use Excel to store data, the only acceptable format is a rectangular, flat file. This is typically saved as a .csv file. What do we mean by this?\nA rectangular file:\n\nStore data only in rows and columns in matrix format (e.g., 10 rows x 5 columns), with no “dangling” cells that have values outside of the grid or more than one table in a spreadsheet.\n\nA flat file:\n\nNo cell formatting, no embedded formulas, no multiple spreadsheets in the same file, and data entered only as alphanumeric characters.\n\nBroman and Woo (2018) provide an excellent guide that expands on these ideas. Essentially, these best practices force you to isolate the analysis from the data - many people use Excel to mix the two, leading to problems.\nNow we can talk about tidy data. The tidy data principles developed by Hadley Wickham (Wickham 2014) are a set of simple rules for storing tabular data that have motivated the development of the wildly popular tidyverse suite of R packages (Wickham et al. 2019). The rules are simple:\n\nEach variable must have its own column;\nEach observation must have its own row; and,\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\nGraphically, these rules are shown below (from Wickham and Grolemund 2017):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following examples show five tables represented in different arrangements. Only one of the tables is tidy - which one?\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4b\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly the first table is tidy - each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each value has its own cell. Table 2 violates the first rule, Table 3 violates the third rule, and tables 4a and 4b violate the first and second rules.\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nDownload this untidy dataset and make it tidy using your preferred software.\n\n\n\n\nBroman, K.

The hope is that you’re able to quickly reach the land of sunshine and bunnies, but the path is treacherous and even insurmountable for some.\nA huge obstacle in using open science is that the toolsets can have steep learning curves. More popular platforms, such as Excel, are used by many because they’re simple and intuitive. However, as noted earlier, FAIR workflows and tools are sacrificed for ease of use.\nAlthough it’s true that adopting new tools will slow forward progress, this is only temporary. Consider your path towards learning new platforms an investment in your future. The immediate benefit may not be apparent, but you’ll soon wonder how you ever got by before.\nIt’s also helpful to think about the broader community that can support you along this journey. Learning alone can be discouraging and we strongly recommend that you tap into the diverse community of educators, mentors, bloggers, and friends that can help. Even you can create a community of practice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nHow can you engage your peers to develop a shared workspace to learn new tools?

Although this is kind of the goal, many view this transparency as a liability. Many fear having their ideas “scooped” or losing credibility because of greater exposure of mistakes. These are real concerns that require consideration when working towards more open workflows.\nIn conventional academic settings, competition for resources (e.g., via grant funding) is a real issue and being open can be seen as a risk to the competitive edge. We cannot dismiss this fact, but rather we can think about a lack of openness as a hindrance to forward progress and stifled creativity.\nThink about being open as a means to finding your next collaborator. Creating FAIR data opens the door for others to engage with your science. In fact, being open can increase the competitiveness of research proposals by building a stronger team that collaborates and shares data through better workflows.\nFirst time practitioners of open science also worry about the risk of “airing their dirty laundry”. By exposing the process and potential mistakes, many worry that their integrity as scientists may be questioned.\nThese fears are unfounded as the scientific process by definition is iterative. Hypotheses are supported or refuted through trial and error - if you’re getting your answer after one pass, you’re probably not doing it right. Making the process more transparent can help build trust as your collaborators can better appreciate how decisions and conclusions were made.\nMistakes in research are also very common, much more so than many people realize. By being open, it is true that mistakes are more visible, but this also provides a mechanism for fixing. Being open can lead to a better product by simply having more eyes on the process. It also helps normalize mistakes as part of the process - perfection is an unrealistic expectation.\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nWhat are your personal concerns about adopting open science?"

By extension, this also applies to institutions. We presented the five schools of open science to help conceptualize ideas and tools when we discuss what it means to different groups.\nThink about your employer and what they might care about if you advocate for adoption of open science. Do you need to convince them that there is value in being open? What is their value proposition? What are the hurdles to achieving openness at your institution?\nFor many institutions, being open may come with IT hurdles as you push for alternative software platforms. Working with IT staff to develop trust and comfort for new software may be your burden, but as always, it’s an investment in the future.\nMaybe there are legal contexts to being open. For example, Florida has the “Sunshine” law that makes all government communications public record. What does this mean for using new workflows in open science? Is this is an improvement or a liability (see previous section)?\nIf you’re an administrator or manager, maybe you’re the one that makes the call about being open. It’s important for you to create a culture that promotes and supports open science. Allow space and time for your staff to learn new skills. Realize that investing time in open science is an investment in the future.\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nWhat does being open mean to you? What do you think being open means to your employer?"

    "text": "5.5 Something is better than nothing\n\n Challenge\n\nDoing all the things is impossible!\n\n Solution\n\nStart small, incremental progress is the name of the game!\nFirst time open science enthusiasts can be overwhelmed by the apparent need to check all the boxes on the open science list. There’s often a prevailing sentiment that you’re not doing open science unless you do all the things. This is simply not true. Just remember that doing something is a huge improvement over doing nothing.\nOpenness in science exists on a spectrum. Your goal should be incremental movement away from the completely closed end of the spectrum. Perhaps you set a goal of only accomplishing one open science task for a particular project. Maybe you start by developing a simple metadata text file or developing a data dictionary. Or maybe you make a commitment to try a new communication platform for collaborative engagement.\nChanneling this concept, Wilson et al. (2017) discuss “good enough practices” in scientific computing, acknowledging that very few of us are professionally trained in these disciplines and sometimes “good enough” is all we can ask for. Lowenberg et al. (2021) also advocate for simple adoption, rather than perfection, when it comes to data citation practices.\nAlso, be mindful of complacency (and apathy, at its very worst). Just because you think you’ve mastered a task doesn’t mean you can’t continue to learn. Always strive to improve yourself and the tools you use to be open. The fact that the toolbox is constantly evolving makes this a necessity.\nSo, be kind to yourself when learning new skills and realize that the first step will likely be frustration, but through frustration comes experience. The more comfortable you become with a task, the more likely you’ll attempt new tasks in the future. I promise you will see a return on your investment.\n\n Exercise and discussion\n\nWhat are some simple things you can do to begin adopting open science?\n\n\n\n\nLowenberg, Daniella, Rachael Lammey, Matthew B Jones, John Chodacki, and Martin Fenner. 2021. “Data Citation: Let’s Choose Adoption over Perfection.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4701079.\n\n\nWilson, G., J.

Some examples:\n\n# print\nprint(\"hello world!\")\n\n[1] \"hello world!\"\n\n# sequence\nseq(1, 10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n# random numbers\nrnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)\n\n  [1]  7.436483 11.064306 12.432552 14.285067 10.175113  8.494749 12.448861\n  [8]  9.188887 12.838934  9.281002  8.963457 10.543503  8.147582 11.283985\n [15]  9.521983  9.718088 12.962912  8.594098  8.957234 10.082893 10.214619\n [22]  7.796665  9.244755  7.730128 12.630845  7.849145 13.962123 10.224491\n [29]  6.979037 11.207938 11.052839  8.942517 10.302605 10.026544  9.657263\n [36] 12.603477  9.912084  9.732195  8.814391  9.186249  9.489908  6.998359\n [43] 12.158400  9.694504  8.820324 10.019984  8.684898  6.675759 13.216165\n [50] 13.362169  8.969915  9.872053  8.894809 11.927414 12.640736  9.421802\n [57] 10.400644 10.087763  9.283378  9.730063 11.930852 10.642830 11.333222\n [64]  6.597851  6.740665 10.586717  8.875874 11.687586 12.699280  9.853541\n [71]  8.115602  9.346345  9.982217 10.530953 12.738169  8.528481  8.561253\n [78] 10.619377 10.576042 13.132264 10.049906 11.948124 12.657978 14.102045\n [85]  8.436035  6.502139  9.193186 10.323130 10.848528  6.211104  8.077079\n [92]  9.678449 12.582105  9.278667 10.703648 10.229949  6.496475 10.558050\n [99] 11.390960 11.314315\n\n# average \nmean(rnorm(100))\n\n[1] 0.0585351\n\n# sum\nsum(rnorm(100))\n\n[1] 2.725458\n\n\nVery often you will see functions used like this:\n\nmy_random_sum <- sum(rnorm(100))\n\nThe first part of the line is the name of an object that you make up. The second bit, <-, is the assignment operator. This tells R to take the result of sum(rnorm(100)) and store it in an object named, my_random_sum. It is stored in the environment and can be used by just executing it’s name in the console.\n\nmy_random_sum\n\n[1] 2.972317\n\n\n\n8.2.1 What is the environment?\nThere are two outcomes when you run code. First, the code will simply print output directly in the console. Second, there is no output because you have stored it as a variable using <-. Output that is stored is saved in the environment. The environment is the collection of named objects that are stored in memory for your current R session."

Packages allow you to include new methods for use in R.\n\n8.3.1 CRAN\nMany packages are available on CRAN, The Comprehensive R Archive Network. This is where you download R and also where most will gain access to packages. As of 2023-04-20, there are 19378 packages on CRAN!\n\n\n8.3.2 Installing packages\nWhen a package gets installed, that means the source code is downloaded and put into your library. A default library location is set for you.\nWe use the install.packages() function to download and install a package. Here, we install the readxl package, used below, which is used to upload data from and Excel file.\n\ninstall.packages(\"readxl\")\n\nYou should see some text in the R console showing progress of the installation and a prompt after installation is done.\nAfter installation, you can load a package using the library() function. This makes all functions in a package available for you to use.\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nAn important aspect of packages is that you only need to download them once, but every time you start RStudio you need to load them with the library() function."

    "text": "8.4 Data structures in R\nNow we can talk about R data structures. Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle information storage.\n\n8.4.1 Vectors (one-dimensional data)\nThe basic data format in R is a vector - a one-dimensional grouping of elements that have the same type. These are all vectors and they are created with the c (concatenate) function:\n\ndbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)\nint_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)\nlog_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)\nchr_var <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\n\nThe four types of vectors are double (or numeric), integer, logical, and character. The following functions can return useful information about the vectors:\n\nclass(dbl_var)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nlength(log_var)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Data frames (two-dimensional data)\nA collection of vectors represented as one data object are often described as two-dimensional data, like a spreadsheet, or in R speak, a data frame. Here’s a simple example:\n\nltrs <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\nnums <- c(1, 2, 3)\nlogs <- c(T, F, T)\nmydf <- data.frame(ltrs, nums, logs)\nmydf\n\n  ltrs nums  logs\n1    a    1  TRUE\n2    b    2 FALSE\n3    c    3  TRUE\n\n\nThe only constraints required to make a data frame are:\n\nEach column (vector) contains the same type of data\nThe number of observations in each column is equal."
