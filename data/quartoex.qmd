# This is the first section

```{r}
print('hello world!')
```

I can write anything I want right here. Here's some **bold text**.

I can also make lists.

1. Item 1

1. Item 2

# This is the second section

## This is a subsection

There's a histogram in @fig-hist.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A really boring plot."
hist(rnorm(100))
```
